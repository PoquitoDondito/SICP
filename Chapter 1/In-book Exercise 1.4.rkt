(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

; This defines a procedure where if b is greater than zero, it outputs the consequent sum of a and b.
; If b is less than zero, it outputs the alternative which subtracts b from a.
; This is because if b is negative, subtracting it will result in a positive, thereby converting it to the absolute value.
; It adds both nubmers while making sure that b is in abolute value.
